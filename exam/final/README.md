Final  

Run main like so, "./main.py /data/cells.mat /results/"  
	First argument is where the data is, second argument is where you want the graphs to be saved.  

Part One:  
Data is transferred to Python array right after importing everything, under the "Saving data to an array." comment.  

Part Two:  
After running main all the graphs will be saved to where you specified results to be, if you want each graph to  
show when running then uncomment plt.show() and comment plt.close(), there are comments in the code telling you  
what uncommenting code will do to the code.  

Part Three:  
MainFunc calls everything and solves for L, running the function with a/b/c/sigma equal to 1 I got 5.192780959023403e-12.  
All functions and their inputs are given comments in the code.
