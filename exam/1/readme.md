1. Assembly and Fortran  
2. Fortran  
3. There's local, centralized, and distributed.  
4. git tag  
5. k = "Python Is Great For String Manipulation."; k[::-1]  
6. Sentax, Semantic, Runtime.  
7. Tuples are not mutable, they cannot be redefined.  
8. All in the file.  
9. A. Because a is not an integer, when b is equated to a the equaling is created by making an alias, not a clone, so when b is appended, a is also changed as b and a are the same exact thing.  
   B. Because b is equated to a + a that means that b is not an alias of a.  
10. They constitute an alias. If you wanted the values to be different you could just go and equate c to whatever you want it to be by itself and not do the multiple assign.  
11. 
12. a. In a script.
    b. The if-block would be applicable to the initial if-block syntax given.
13. No they are not, == is checking if the two sides are the same value while is checks if the two sides are the same information in respects to how the computer sees it.  
14. 
15. a. (a,b) = (b,a)  
    b. [a,b] = [b,a]
