**Part One:**  
- Done and answer verified with Wolfram|Alpha.    
**Part Two:**  
- Done all explanations are in code.    
**Part Three:**  
- Done    
**Part Four:**  
     - a is given value 5, because this is an int b is equated to a, copying over the same id. The print gives the same id's because the values were copied from a to b. On line 5 b is copied over to c, then b is given a new value, but because it was a copy it does not affect other variables. The first print gives int's and the second gives us id's, a being the same and not changing, b changing due to the value change to 5 and c being equal to a, because it was equal to b before it changed value. On line 10 a is again copied in for b, giving it the same original id as it had because a hadn't changed, we again change b's value, however it's the same as it was and so the copied data stays relevant and is not changed. The print shows us the original a id as it hasn't changed and a the same for b as the new value assigned to b doesn't change b's id as that's the int value given earlier.    
     - a is given an array value, because it isn't a simple data type a is simply aliased into b, not copied. We get a print that shows the id's because the same because the id was aliased. We then append 1 into b, but because it was aliased both a and b are changed. We see in the second print that the value is the same for a and b. We also see that the id is also the same for a and b. Also there was an error in the second print statement due to lack of parenthesis.    
     - a is given a value, b is equal to a list where the one object is a. The first print shows that the the values are still the same, a and b being [5] because that's their value or only object in their list. The id's though are different because a is a list, but b is a list of a list, so the value of a is neither copied or aliased. We then get another assignment statement, saying that b is equal to all of list a. Because list a is only [5] the values in the next print are the same. However the id's are changed again, a remains constant and b changes because the value code wise is different.    
     - a is assigned as a tuple. b is assigned as a tuple of a, a simple data type. Because it is simple a is copied to b. We see this is the id's. b is then equated to all of a, however now there's a list involved, so instead a is aliased into b, id's are the same.    
**Part Five:**  
Not done. :(
