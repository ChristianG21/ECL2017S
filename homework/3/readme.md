Part One:  
Syntax error: On line 26, the format function is missing a period in front of it.  
It's written as "format" when it should be ".format".  
  
Runtime error: One of the most basic runtime errors occurs on line 45. This is where  
the coder attempted to divide 1 by 0. This simply doesn't work and creates a runtime  
error where the program can't perform the math presented to it.  
  
Semantic error: On line 26, the coder intended complex(5,-15) to both create an  
imaginary number, but to also perform a square root operation. However, that's not  
what the complex() function does, resulting in an improper output.  
  
Part Two:  
Done, located in "python\_is\_the\_best_language.py"
